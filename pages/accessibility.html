<h1 class="m-t-0">Accessibility</h1>
<p>
  The State of California’s website has been developed in compliance with
  Section D of the California Government Code 11135. Code 11135 requires that
  all electronic and information technology developed or purchased by the State
  of California Government is accessible to people with disabilities. There are
  various types of physical disabilities that impact user interaction on the
  web. Vision loss, hearing loss, limited manual dexterity, and cognitive
  disabilities are examples, with each having different means by which to access
  electronic information effectively. Our goal is to provide a good web
  experience for all visitors.

      attributes provide a written description of the image, which is accessible
      to screen readers, and it is visible when the mouse is placed over the
      image. This is also useful for people who have images turned off on their
      browser, in which case a description will display where the image used to
      be.
